# The Effect of a Movie's Genre and Length on its' Ratings

The purpose of this project is to analyze patterns in movie genres and how they relate to the resulting score/rating they received by users. By using data from the last ten years (2010-2019), I make these comparisons and also highlight top directors and movies in this period. To accomplish this, I used the downloadable IMDB dataset found on their [website](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/). Due to the large size of this dataset, I seperately cleaned the raw data into a more manageable size for this project. The process for this initial data cleaning can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zJK4rymFNVZYmNoM2xfn_U6AR5qYQSZs). 

# General Info

IMDB is an online searchable database containing information on movies and tv shows, such as credits. For more info about IMDB, you can visit their [website](https://help.imdb.com/article/imdb/general-information/what-is-imdb/G836CY29Z4SGNMK5?ref_=helpsect_cons_1_1#).

The data was pulled from IMDB in December of 2019. As explained in the project, this skewed some of the 2019 results, but was factored in during the analysis. I plan to update the data sometime in mid 2020 to revaluate the data.
